## About This Project

Take a look at where my coding journey began: a Star Wars fansite and my very first GitHub repo. I built this project during my first semester in the Computer Science program at my university.

The site started with Notepad++, and shortly after, a friend introduced me to VS Code — complete with a magic button that formatted everything in an instant. Before that, I had been manually aligning thousands of lines of HTML and CSS . . .

This project is more than just code; it’s a reminder of my early days as a developer!
