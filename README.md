## About This Project

Embark on a nostalgic journey to where my coding adventures began â€” with a **Star Wars fansite**. This project was the first real-world application of my burgeoning coding skills during my initial semester in the Computer Science program at my university. 

The site was lovingly crafted line by line in Notepad++, long before I discovered the wonders of VS Code and more sophisticated web development tools. Imagine manually spacing out nearly a thousand lines of HTML & CSS. It was a daunting task, but looking back, it's an experience Iâ€™ll cherish forever. ðŸ¥º

This project is more than just code on a screen; it's a pixelated slice of my early coding daysâ€”a time when every semicolon was a tiny victory and every closing tag a high five. Itâ€™s a reminder of where I started and how far I've come.

If you enjoy your visit, consider giving it a star! ðŸŒŸ
