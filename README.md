## About This Project

Take a look at where my coding journey started: a Star Wars fansite. This project marked my first real use of coding skills, developed during my first semester in the Computer Science program at university.

The site was initially crafted using Notepad++, and right after, I discovered VS Code — complete with a button to instantly format everything. Imagine manually aligning thousands of lines of HTML & CSS, only to find out such a shortcut existed. It was a tedious task, but I accidentally became a pro at HTML spacing before discovering there was an easier way!

This project is more than just code on a screen; it's a pixelated slice of my early coding days—a time when every semicolon was a tiny victory and every closing tag a high five. It was my first repo on GitHub, serving as a reminder of where I started and how far I've come.
